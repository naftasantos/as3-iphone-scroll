AS3 iPhone Scroll
=================

This library was created to fulfill the need of creating iPhone-like scrolls for touch input using Action Script 3.

When this library was created, no other tool existed and it was done in a rush.

So, if you really need a library, I **strongly recomend** this other one: http://codecanyon.net/item/air-as3-touch-scroll/3914642
